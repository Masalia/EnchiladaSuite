# Burrito:

Burrito is a wrapper for the Manhattanizer.R (expansion of Sariel Hubner's original Helimap.v.1 pipeline). This wrapper treats environments and traits individually, producing a Manhattan plot and list of significant SNPs for each trait_environment combination, as determined by a USER specified environments.list and traits.list.

Associations are run through the program EMMAX (Kang et al., 2010), which is an expedited version of the program EMMA (Kang et al., 2008). EMMAX is run with kinship (IBS) and structure (PCA) to reduce spurious associations. Preferences for this wrapper are controlled in the configuration file ("Asada.config").

It’s important to note that “environments” don’t need to be treatments or locations, but can also represent any grouping of phenotype data including the difference/GMP/relative difference...etc between two environments. 

How to run:
(1) In the EnchiladaSuite.pl script the following line is presented:
   
   perl Burrito.pl Environments.list Traits.list
    
The arguments Environments.list and Traits.list are two list files that list the environments your traits exist in. This can be a singular environment or numerous environments. The Traits.list argument is similar but corresponds to phenotypic traits you want to map. Each argument is a separate file in the main Enchilada Suite directory.

To run this module separately without the others, comment out the other modules.
