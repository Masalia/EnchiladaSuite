# EnchiladaSuite

Hello, and welcome to the whole Enchilada Suite! This is a bioinformatic pipeline created to help streamline genome-wide association studies for those using the sunflower association mapping population first described by Mandel et al (2011; http://www.theburkelab.org/reprints/TAG2011.pdf) and more expanded upon by Mandel et al (2013; http://www.theburkelab.org/reprints/PLoSGenet2013.pdf). 

The Enchilada Suite is designed to work as a series of self-contained sequential modules: (1) Burrito, (2) SALSA, and (3) GUAC, which are defined in more detail below. The downloadable folder is pre-partitioned into the main folders (A) Enchilada Suite, (B) Outputs, (C) Phenos, and (D) Scripts. Enchilada Suite houses each module as a separate folder, each of which contains all necessary folders and programs to run. Outputs is the location where the various plots and tables generated by the pipeline are placed. Phenos is the folder where least-square mean values of all measured traits are housed (see Burrito section below). Finally, Scripts is a folder that houses the scripts used in this pipeline.
