#SALSA:

This pipeline is a direct follow up to the Burrito module. It is designed to take significantly associated SNPs from a trait_environment combination (*.sigsnps file), and identify LD boundaries for regions/clusters of interest by looking at pairwise LD across significant SNPs on a chromosome. Markers are grouped through LDselect, without outputs displaying pairwise r2 values.

#How to run:

perl SALSA.pl Environments.list Traits.list

Contents in SALSA directory:

1. ConvertToPB.pl → perl script to create the format that lDSelect.pl uses.
2. ldSelect.pl → program that clusters significant markers
3. Tomato.config → configuration file
4. XRQ_213.tfam → tfam file generated by Plinkv1.9 (same as Burrito)
5. XRQ_213.tped → tped file generated by Plinkv1.9 (same as Burrito)

#Outputs:
There are three outputs per trait_environment.
 
1. Trait_Environment_AllChr_R2.txt → This is a table that lists ALL pairwise R2 values per trait_environment. This table is for all chromosomes.

2. Trait_Environment_GuacPrep.txt →This is a subset of the AllChr_R2 table, that only lists R2 values of pairwise markers that is >= 0.8. The “Diff” category is the difference between the left (start) and right (stop) marker. A difference of zero (0) means that the start and stop markers are the same, and is indicative of only ONE significant marker on that chromosome.

3. Trait_Environment_Chr_#_LDplot.pdf → these are PDF LD plots, and are stashed in the “Outputs/PDFs/LD_Plots” directory. This script only prints plots for chromosomes with multiple significant SNPs per triat per environment. The diagnonal is colored to match the bin in which a marker was placed.
